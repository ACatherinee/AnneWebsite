     <p><center><font face="cantal" color="black" size="5"> Hi my name is Anne Catherine Gerones from grade 10 Emilio Jacinto,<br>
	 i am 15 years old. I'm a introvert person before but I tried to get out<br> in my
	 comfort zone and tried to explore some things. I tried to communicate <br> to other
	 people. My ambition in life is to be a F.A or flight attendant, and one <br> of my goals
	 in life is to finish school and i also want to travel and spoil myself <br> and my family
	 for the sucess of my hardwork in the future. To be honest, <br> studying is really hard
	 and stressful sometimes. But i, we should not let <br> this emotion or feeling to make
	 us think that we should <br> just stop chasing our dreams because its hard for us.
